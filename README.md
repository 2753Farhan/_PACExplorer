3. **Games**: Interactive games related to PACE data, making the learning experience fun and helping students explore scientific concepts through play.

### Additional Features:
- **Data Visualization**: Converts PACE satellite data into graphs and other interactive elements, enabling students to explore scientific information visually.
- **Student-Centric Design**: Uses language and examples relatable to young learners, with customizable learning paths based on students' levels and interests.
- **Customizable Learning Paths**: Allows students to focus on specific aspects such as ecosystems, clouds, or plankton, fostering an in-depth and self-paced learning experience.

## Impact Potential
PACExplorer has the potential to transform how students perceive and learn about space and environmental sciences. By providing an intuitive, interactive, and fun learning platform, it can enhance students' engagement with science and technology. Additionally, by building awareness of climate and ecosystems, PACExplorer contributes to creating a future generation that values environmental stewardship.

## Agile Development Model
The development of PACExplorer followed an Agile model:
1. **Iteration Planning**: Each feature was planned and executed in iterative sprints to ensure continuous improvement and flexibility.
2. **Backlog Management**: Features and tasks were prioritized based on educational value, student engagement, and feedback.
3. **Sprint Reviews**: Regular reviews of completed sprints helped refine the application based on user feedback and testing.
4. **Continuous Integration**: Integrated small, frequent updates to ensure stability and adaptability throughout the development cycle.
